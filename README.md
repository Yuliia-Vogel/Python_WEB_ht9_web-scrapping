1) pip install Scrapy

2) terminal command: scrapy crawl authors_file_creation  --> authors.json file is created (or changed if already existed)
3) terminal command: scrapy crawl quotes_file_creation   --> quotes.json file is created (or changed if already existed)

4) Now you can use two created json-files for work with the Homework 8 script (located at GitHub https://github.com/Yuliia-Vogel/Python_WEB_ht8_MongoDB-Redis)
